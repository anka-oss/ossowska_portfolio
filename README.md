## 📚 About
This portfolio was built to:
- Present my frontend and JavaScript projects,
- Share my professional story through a blog,
- Demonstrate real-world skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, accessibility, SEO, and deployment,

- **Google Analytics** - Traffic monitoring
- **SEO Best Practices** - Optimized meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt

## 🚀 Deployment
The site is deployed automatically to Home.pl hosting every time code is pushed to GitHub.
- FTP credentials are securely stored in GitHub Secrets.
- Files like .git, README.md, deploy.yml, and node_modules are excluded from deployment.
