                    <h3>Mom in Tech | Woman in IT | Career Change | Coding After Maternity</h3>
                    <p>In November, just three months after giving birth, I decided to return to work. Why? Because I could. Because I wanted to. My job in IT allows me to work remotely, I don't have to leave the house, and — what’s more — my husband is home full-time too. For us, it was simply a matter of good organization. And truthfully? I needed to reconnect with people, with tasks — with <i>me</i>.</p>
                    <p>To me, it wasn’t a big deal. I spoke openly about my return. So I was genuinely shocked when I heard comments like:</p>
                    <p>“Wow… I feel sorry for you.”</p>
                    <p>“Really? That’s kind of sad.”</p>
                    <p>The first time, I was speechless. I felt the need to explain myself — as if I’d done something wrong. But I hadn’t abandoned my baby. I still breastfed, cuddled, stayed close. Yet these comments made me question everything.</p>
                    <p>Not a single person asked:</p>
                    <p>“Why did you go back?”</p>
                    <p>“How do you manage it?”</p>
                    <p>“Is this what you wanted?”</p>
                    <p>Let alone: “Do you need any support?” — if they really thought something was wrong.</p>
                    <p>Those comments planted doubt in my mind. Suddenly, working 4 hours a day at my laptop felt like a massive, harmful decision — something that would deprive my child of love and attention.</p>
                    <h2>👩‍💻 Coding mom? Yes, and that’s okay.</h2>
                    <p>This is why I’m writing this. Ladies, let’s not do this to each other. Don’t pass judgment on another woman’s choice without understanding her context. New moms are vulnerable. We try to do what’s best for our baby, our family, <i>and</i> ourselves — in that order.</p>
                    <p>So if a mom decides to go back to work, ask her why. Ask how she’s doing. And if it’s her choice — respect it. Support her. Even if you would’ve done things differently.</p>
                    <p>My job in tech gave me more than a paycheck. It gave me space, purpose, and room to grow. Working remotely as a developer brings flexibility — something many moms dream of.</p>
                    <p>If you’re a mom thinking about returning to work but unsure whether it’s the right move — message me. I’d love to talk.</p>
                    <p>And if you’re considering a <b>career change into tech</b> — follow my journey. I’m right in the middle of it, and maybe you’ll find some inspiration in my experience.</p>
